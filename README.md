Kaggle: Give Me Some Credit
# Credit Risk Prediction Project: Give Me Some Credit (Kaggle)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict credit risk, specifically the probability that an individual will experience financial distress (serious delinquency) in the next two years. This is a common problem in the financial industry and the basis of the "Give Me Some Credit" Kaggle competition.

## Goal

The primary objective was to improve on the state-of-the-art in credit scoring by predicting the probability of financial distress.

## Submission Details

My submission to the "Give Me Some Credit" Kaggle competition achieved the following scores:

* **Public Score:** 0.85984
* **Private Score:** 0.86654

The submission file was named `submission.csv`.

*(**Note:** Since you selected 0 out of 5 submissions to be evaluated for your final leaderboard score, Kaggle auto-selected up to 5 submissions from your public best-scoring unselected submissions. The evaluated submission with the best Private Score is used for your final score. This particular `submission.csv` was completed after the deadline.)*

## Project Approach (Likely based on typical Kaggle solutions for this problem)

*(Since the screenshot only shows the submission, I'll fill in a typical approach for this competition. You should adjust this section to accurately reflect the methods you actually used in your code, like the Jupyter Notebook we previously discussed.)*

1.  **Data Loading & Initial Exploration:** Understanding the dataset, features, and target variable distribution.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * **Handling Missing Values:** Imputation strategies for `MonthlyIncome` and `NumberOfDependents`.
    * **Outlier Treatment:** Addressing anomalous values in `age` and delinquency-related features.
    * **Feature Engineering/Transformation:** Log transformations for skewed features like `DebtRatio` and `RevolvingUtilizationOfUnsecuredLines`.
3.  **Addressing Class Imbalance:** The target variable (`SeriousDlqin2yrs`) is highly imbalanced. Techniques like `scale_pos_weight` in XGBoost and stratified sampling during cross-validation are crucial.
4.  **Model Selection:** XGBoost is a strong performer for tabular data due to its efficiency and accuracy.
5.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV with cross-validation to optimize model parameters.
6.  **Model Evaluation:** Performance measured primarily by ROC AUC score, as well as precision, recall, and F1-score for a more comprehensive understanding of performance on the minority class.

## Files in this Repository

* `credit_risk_prediction.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and prediction generation.
* `data/`: Directory containing the raw datasets (`cs-training.csv`, `cs-test.csv`).
* `submission.csv`: The generated submission file with predicted probabilities for the test set.
* `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run the Project Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub details.)*
2.  **Install necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost jupyterlab
    ```
3.  **Ensure the `cs-training.csv` and `cs-test.csv` files are placed inside the `data/` directory.**
4.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
5.  **Run all cells in `credit_risk_prediction.ipynb`** sequentially. This will execute the entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to generating the `submission.csv` file.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a robust machine learning approach to a real-world credit risk prediction problem, achieving competitive performance metrics.
